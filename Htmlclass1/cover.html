<p>I am writing to express my interest in the Web Developer position. I have a B.Tech degree and strong <br>skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.</p>
<p>I have worked on projects like an Inventory Management System and an Amazon clone using the MERN <br> stack. These experiences helped me understand web development and improve my coding skills. I am also <br>familiar with collaborating with teams to create user-friendly web solutions.</p>
<p>I am eager to bring my skills to your team and contribute to your projects. I look forward to discussing <br> how I can help. Thank you for considering my application</p>
